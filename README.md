This project research explore the use of machine learning models to make disease predictions based on the symptoms patients report using the Disease and Symptoms Dataset 2023. The research will utilise an approach to the project management structure, implementing both PMBOK and Prince2. Four classification models, i.e., Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, decision tree classifier, and K-Neighbours classifier, were developed and compared based on the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify the distribution patterns of diseases and the correlation between them. The outcomes showed that the Decision Tree Classifier showed the best performance indicators and thus was best suited to multi-class symptom-based diagnosis. The results of the project illustrate the future of data-driven techniques in healthcare decision support and identify the limitations (namely, data imbalance and hardware limitations). Future research suggestions are to incorporate more data and tune hyperparameters to enhance accuracy and analyse complex ensemble methods.
